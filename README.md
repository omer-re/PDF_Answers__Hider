# PDF Answers Hider
When your PDF past exams has the answers marked and highlighted - this tool removes it

What does this app do?
Take a look
![Usage example](https://github.com/omer-re/PDF_Answers__Hider/blob/master/what%20I%20do.jpg)


## PDF_Answers_Hider 2.0 - main updates:
- New and improved scraping logic that keeps tables, equations and sketches [thank you, Boaz Shebo Berger for your great contribution]
- Batch action- choose multiple PDF files at once.
- Minor changes in GUI and buttons' descriptions.


## Instructions
1. download the .py file and run it on your python interperter OR just download the EXE file which made of the same script.
if your windows warn you about it, click "more info" and then allow it to run.
2. choose a pdf file with answers marked on it, then choose where to locate the "clean" pdf and let it run.

## NOTES
1. Adobe Reader doesn't like some files, I am not sure why. If it happens to you - try to open the clean file using Chrome, FireFox, Foxit etc.
2. It isn't an AI, ML, CV fancy script, it basically removes a layer of the pdf of shapes, leaving the text as it is.
If there are other images, sketches or some other objects on this layer- they might be removed as well, take it into considerations.

## Contribution

If you know how to fix the windows warning or the Adobe in-compatibility - LMK.
